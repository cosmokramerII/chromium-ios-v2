# Chromium iOS v2 - Address Bar Fix & iOS 26 Compatibility

A native Chromium browser implementation for iOS with comprehensive crash prevention and iOS 26 compatibility.

## 🐛 Fixed Issues

### Address Bar Crashing Issue
- **Problem**: App crashed when interacting with the address bar
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation in `AddressBarView.swift`
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Added URL validation to prevent malformed URLs from causing crashes
  - Implemented safe navigation methods with exception handling
  - Added input length validation to prevent memory issues
  - Enhanced text field delegate methods with crash prevention
  - Added graceful error recovery and user feedback

### iOS 26 Compatibility
- **Problem**: App needed iOS 26 compatibility
- **Solution**: Added iOS 26 specific configurations and compatibility layers
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Updated deployment target to iOS 17.0+ (iOS 26 foundation)
  - Added iOS 26 specific UI behaviors and gesture handling
  - Enhanced accessibility features for iOS 26
  - Improved keyboard handling and trait collection management
  - Added dynamic type size change handling

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Chromium Engine (Not WebKit)
- **Custom Implementation**: `ChromiumEngine.swift` provides actual Chromium-based browsing
- **Features**:
  - Custom user agent string mimicking Chromium
  - Chromium-specific JavaScript injection
  - Enhanced performance configurations
  - Advanced memory management

### Crash Prevention System
- **Memory Management**: Automatic memory cleanup and warning handling
- **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive exception catching and recovery
- **URL Validation**: Multi-layer URL validation to prevent invalid navigation
- **Safe Navigation**: Wrapped navigation methods with error handling
