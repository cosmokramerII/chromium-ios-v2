# Chromium iOS v2

A WebKit-based web browser for iOS with iOS 14+ compatibility and robust address bar functionality.

**Note**: Due to Apple's App Store requirements, all iOS browsers must use WebKit (WKWebView) as their rendering engine. While this browser is styled after Chromium and uses a Chrome-compatible user agent string for site compatibility, it uses Apple's WebKit engine, not Blink.

## ðŸŽ‰ Project Status: Ready to Build!

All errors have been fixed! The project is now ready to build and create IPA files. See **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** for immediate build instructions.

**Recent Fixes:**
- âœ… Project structure corrected (proper .xcodeproj bundle)
- âœ… iOS deployment target fixed (iOS 14.0, was incorrectly iOS 26.0)
- âœ… Assets catalog added (AppIcon, AccentColor)
- âœ… Build script enhanced to create IPA files
- âœ… All configuration issues resolved

**Quick Build:** Run `./build.sh` on macOS with Xcode to create the IPA.

## Features

- **iOS 14+ Compatible**: Updated deployment target and API usage for iOS 14 and later
- **Crash-Free Address Bar**: Comprehensive crash prevention and memory management
- **WebKit-Based Engine**: Uses Apple's WKWebView (required for all iOS browsers)
- **Chrome-Compatible User Agent**: Configured for optimal site compatibility
- **Robust URL Handling**: Smart URL validation and search query detection
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All UI updates are performed on the main thread
- **Modern iOS Design**: Uses Auto Layout and supports both iPhone and iPad

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AddressBarController**: Manages the address bar UI and URL input validation
   - Comprehensive crash prevention through proper memory management
   - Debounced text input to prevent excessive processing
   - Thread-safe URL updates
   - Smart URL validation and search query detection

2. **BrowserViewController**: Main browser interface with WebView integration
   - WKWebView (Apple's WebKit engine, required for iOS)
   - Progress tracking and loading state management
   - Proper delegate cleanup to prevent crashes

3. **ViewController**: Root view controller that manages the browser interface

## Crash Fixes Implemented

### Memory Management
- Proper deallocation methods with cleanup of delegates and observers
- Timer invalidation to prevent retain cycles
- KVO observer removal in dealloc methods

### Thread Safety
- All UI updates dispatched to main queue
- Thread-safe URL display updates
- Proper handling of concurrent operations

### Input Validation
- URL length limits to prevent buffer overflows
- Comprehensive URL validation and sanitization
- Graceful handling of nil and empty inputs

### Error Handling
- Proper error handling for WebView creation failures
- Network error presentation with user-friendly messages
- Graceful degradation when components fail to initialize

## iOS 14+ Compatibility

- **Deployment Target**: Set to iOS 14.0
- **Modern API Usage**: Updated to use latest iOS APIs where available
- **WebKit Configuration**: Configured for modern iOS WebKit features
- **Scene Support**: Full support for iOS 13+ scene-based lifecycle

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for the address bar functionality:

- Crash prevention tests
- URL validation tests
- Threading safety tests
- Memory leak detection
- UI state management tests

## Build Requirements

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 14.0 SDK or later
- Deployment target: iOS 14.0

## Installation

### Quick Start
For a quick guide to building and installing the IPA, see **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)**.

### Detailed Steps
1. Open `ChromiumIOSv2.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your target device or simulator (iOS 14+)
3. Configure code signing in "Signing & Capabilities"
4. Build and run the project

### Building IPA
```bash
./build.sh
```

For comprehensive build and installation instructions, see **[BUILD_IPA.md](BUILD_IPA.md)**.

### Validation
To verify the project is correctly configured:
```bash
./validate.sh
```

## Usage

The browser provides a familiar interface with:
- Back/Forward navigation buttons
- Refresh button
- Address bar with smart URL completion
- Progress indicator for page loads

Simply tap the address bar, enter a URL or search term, and press Go or Return to navigate.

## Technical Notes

### WebView Configuration
The browser uses Apple's WKWebView (WebKit engine) configured with optimal settings:
- Custom user agent string for Chrome compatibility with websites
- JavaScript enabled
- Media playback without user interaction
- Proper process pool configuration

**Important**: iOS browsers are required by Apple to use WebKit. This browser cannot use Blink (Chrome's engine) as it is not available on iOS.

### Address Bar Features
- Automatic HTTPS prefix addition
- Search query detection and Google search integration
- URL validation and error feedback
- Debounced input processing for performance

### Error Recovery
- Graceful handling of network errors
- WebView initialization failure recovery
- Memory pressure handling
