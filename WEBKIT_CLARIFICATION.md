# Changes Made to Clarify Browser Engine

## Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to clarify that this browser uses WebKit (not Blink) as required by iOS.

## Background

The original issue requested making the browser "based exclusively on blink and not at all on webkit". However, this is technically impossible on iOS due to Apple's App Store guidelines, which mandate that all iOS browsers must use WebKit (WKWebView).

**Key Facts:**
- All iOS browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari) use WebKit
- Blink (Chrome's rendering engine) is not available on iOS
- This is an Apple policy, not a limitation of this project

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- Updated main description to state "WebKit-based web browser"
- Added note explaining iOS requires WebKit for all browsers
- Changed "Chromium-Based Engine" to "WebKit-Based Engine" in features list
- Updated WebView Configuration section to clarify WebKit usage
- Added reference to new ENGINE_INFO.md file
- Updated license section to clarify this is inspired by Chrome's UI design

#### ENGINE_INFO.md (NEW)
- Comprehensive documentation explaining WebKit vs Blink
- Explains why iOS browsers must use WebKit
- Clarifies what each engine is and where they're used
- Comparison table showing differences
- Technical details about what WKWebView provides
- Explains the "Chromium" naming and user agent string

#### CRASH_FIXES.md
- Updated section title to "WebKit APIs (Apple's Required Engine)"
- Added clarification about iOS browser engine requirements
- Updated conclusion to mention WebKit and Chrome-compatible configuration

#### FIXES_APPLIED.md
- Added note about WebKit being required for all iOS browsers
- Updated WebKit Features section

#### UI_PREVIEW.md
- Changed "iOS 26" references to "iOS 14+"
- Updated headers to remove "Chromium" confusion

### 2. Code Comment Updates

#### ChromiumIOSv2/AppDelegate.h & .m
- Changed comment from "Chromium-based browser" to "WebKit-based browser (Apple's required engine)"
- Updated initialization comment to mention WebKit

#### ChromiumIOSv2/BrowserViewController.h & .m
- Changed comment from "Chromium integration" to "WebKit integration"
- Added note in setupWebViewConfiguration explaining iOS requires WebKit
- Updated user agent comment to clarify it's for site compatibility, actual engine is WebKit

#### ChromiumIOSv2/ViewController.h & .m
- Changed comment from "Chromium browser" to "WebKit-based browser"

#### ChromiumIOSv2/ChromiumConfig.h
- Updated header comment to "WebKit configuration constants"
- Changed CHROMIUM_VERSION to BROWSER_VERSION
- Added comment clarifying Chrome version is for user agent compatibility

### 3. Build Script Updates

#### build.sh
- Updated header comment to clarify "WebKit-based browser for iOS"
- Updated echo message

#### validate.sh
- Updated header comment
- Updated echo message

## What Was NOT Changed

### Functional Code
- No changes to actual implementation code
- No changes to how the browser works
- No changes to WebView configuration (already using WKWebView correctly)
- No changes to Info.plist or project settings

### Project Name
- Project is still named "ChromiumIOSv2"
- This name reflects the UI design inspiration, not the engine

### User Agent String
- Still uses Chrome-compatible user agent for site compatibility
- This is standard practice and helps with website compatibility

## Technical Accuracy

After these changes, the project now accurately:

1. ✅ States it uses WebKit (WKWebView) - the only option on iOS
2. ✅ Explains why Blink cannot be used on iOS
3. ✅ Clarifies the user agent string is for compatibility, not engine indication
4. ✅ Documents the iOS browser engine requirements
5. ✅ Provides comprehensive explanation in ENGINE_INFO.md

## Validation

- All changes pass validation script
- No build errors introduced
- Documentation is now technically accurate
- Project structure remains intact

## Files Modified

1. README.md
2. ENGINE_INFO.md (new)
3. CRASH_FIXES.md
4. FIXES_APPLIED.md
5. UI_PREVIEW.md
6. ChromiumIOSv2/AppDelegate.h
7. ChromiumIOSv2/AppDelegate.m
8. ChromiumIOSv2/BrowserViewController.h
9. ChromiumIOSv2/BrowserViewController.m
10. ChromiumIOSv2/ChromiumConfig.h
11. ChromiumIOSv2/ViewController.h
12. ChromiumIOSv2/ViewController.m
13. build.sh
14. validate.sh

Total: 14 files (13 modified, 1 new)

## Conclusion

These changes provide clarity about what browser engine is actually used while explaining the technical constraints of iOS development. The browser continues to work exactly as before, but documentation and comments now accurately reflect the reality that all iOS browsers must use WebKit.
